Udacity fulstack nanodegree project 1

A script to generate a page of film posters and, when clicked, to display the trailer. The media.py file contains the movie class, and fresh_tomatoes.py contains the script to generate html. These two modules are initialised in entertainment_centre.py.

This version was slightly updated from the basic script in the course to include a mouseover information icon which pops up additional info on each movie.

To use, simply run `python entertainment_centre.py` from the command line, or open that file using Python IDLE and run it from there.
